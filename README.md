# Router Firmware Reverse Engineering — TOTOLINK N150RT

> **Status:** W01 complete (recon + unpacking). Hardware phase pending.

A firmware reverse-engineering study of a consumer router I own, done for
learning and as a portfolio piece. The goal is to take a real, end-of-life
embedded device, rebuild an understanding of its firmware from nothing, and
trace **already-publicly-disclosed** vulnerabilities down to the responsible
function in the binary.

The point is not the device. It is being able to take an undocumented binary
system on an unfamiliar architecture, build understanding from zero, and reason
about its security — with results another person can reproduce.

## Target

- **Device:** TOTOLINK N150RT, hardware V2.0 — a 2018-era 150 Mbps consumer router
- **Support status:** end-of-life, no longer vendor-supported
- **Ownership:** personally owned; all work is on my own hardware
- **Platform (measured, not assumed):** big-endian MIPS-I / o32 · Realtek SDK ·
  Boa 0.94.14rc21 running as root · SquashFS 4.0 root filesystem ·
  handlers dispatched under `/boafrm/form*`

## Selected findings from W01

Two firmware images were analysed: **V2.1.2 (2015-08-25)** and **V3.4.0
(2020-10-30)**. They bracket both public disclosure events affecting this
device, which turns a teardown into a before/after comparison.

- **The 2015 build is the vendor's response to Pierre Kim's July 2015
  disclosure — and the response was to comment out one line.** `/etc/init.d/rcS`
  contains `#skt&`; `/bin/skt`, a socket-driven `system()` wrapper, is still
  shipped and still executable. Not starting a backdoor and not having one are
  different properties.
- **In the 2020 build — nine months after the Realtek SDK full disclosure —
  `/web/config.dat` is a symlink to `/var/config.dat`,** and `rcS` copies `/web/*`
  into the live document root. The exposure path behind CVE-2019-19822 is
  structurally intact. Whether it is *reachable unauthenticated* depends on Boa's
  request-authorisation code, which is W03's job; the structural evidence is
  recorded without over-claiming.
- **`formSysCmd` does not appear in either binary** — but `sysCmdselect`,
  `sysCmdLog` and `/tmp/syscmd.log` do. The CVE-2019-19824 feature is compiled
  in; only its dispatch name is missing from the string table.
- **Published specs say 2 MB of flash. The firmware's own flash map needs at
  least 3.57 MiB.** Settled physically in W02.
- **No exploit mitigations anywhere:** no canary, RELRO, PIE or FORTIFY, and no
  `PT_GNU_STACK` on most binaries — an executable stack. Boa runs as root.

## Reproducing

[`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md) walks through this from a bare Windows machine,
assuming no prior reverse-engineering knowledge. The short version:

```bash
make setup     # install the toolchain (Linux side)
make verify    # G0: every tool answers when called
make fetch     # download + hash-verify the firmware (not redistributed here)
make unpack    # carve and extract the root filesystems
make recon     # regenerate everything under reports/
make test      # fwrecon test suite
```

```powershell
# Windows side: pinned JDK 21 + Ghidra 12.1.2, no admin rights needed
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\setup\setup-windows.ps1 all
.\ghidra\import.ps1 -Label 2.1.2 -Binary \\wsl$\Ubuntu-24.04\home\<user>\fwre-work\extracted\v2.1.2\squashfs-root\bin\boa
```

A pinned container image is in [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile); CI
builds it on every push, so the toolchain pins are checked continuously.

Artefacts live outside the repository, on a Linux filesystem — see
[`docs/workspace-layout.md`](docs/workspace-layout.md) for why that is a
correctness requirement here and not a preference.

## Scope & ethics

- Work is limited to **hardware I own**, in an **isolated lab environment** —
  nothing is connected to production networks during testing.
- The focus is **understanding publicly disclosed issues**, not producing
  weaponised exploits.
- I do **not** test third-party, production, or ISP-owned devices.
- **Coordinated disclosure:** anything genuinely new goes to **TWCERT/CC** before
  any public discussion.
- Vendor firmware is **not redistributed** here — only the provenance and hashes
  needed to obtain and verify identical copies.
